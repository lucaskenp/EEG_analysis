This is the final work of my major in Computer Engineering, in the Federal University of Cear√°, Brazil. The aim was to detect seizures in eeg signals by anomaly detection techniques. This repository contains the Matlab functions and the preprocessed data from the open database CHB-MIT (https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/). For a detailed discussion about the algorithms and results obtained, please refer to the Cabral 2017.pdf file in this repository (writen in portuguese).
